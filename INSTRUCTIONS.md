# HOW TO USE

## 1. Upload your save file on the website

Your save file should be located at the following path:
`<TEW9 directory>/Databases/<Database Name>/SaveGames/<Save Name>/TEW9Save.mdb`
![Step 1](/instruction_images/step1.png) 

Once the process is completed, a CSV file with the resulting data will be downloaded to your device.

## 2. Make a copy of the TEW Save Tracker Sheet file

Click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WRCjQA4aZF6mn9nBHoCwZlOfbaBC-XaNda2_EatEKjs/copy) to make a copy of the Sheet on your own Google storage.

## 3. Move columns AQ, AR, AS, AT all the way to the right of the sheet

These columns are the only columns that do not contain data from the game. Instead, they are supposed to be filled by the spreadsheet user for organizational purposes. They can either be moved all the way to the right of the Sheet, to avoid alignement issues later on, or they can be outright deleted if you do not intend on using them.

## 4. Select and delete every row below row 2

Click on the `3` indicating row number 3 on the left. This should select the whole row.

Once the whole row is selected, press `Ctrl + Shift + â†“ Down` to also select every row below row 3.
![Step 4b](/instruction_images/step4b.png) 

Right click on the selection, and press `Delete selected rows`. This should leave you with only one row.

## 5. Import the CSV file previously downloaded


While selecting Cell A2 (the cell displaying "The Rock" on the above screenshot), click on `File > Import > Upload` and upload the CSV file that was downloaded after step 1.
![Step 5a](/instruction_images/step5a.png) 

Once the upload finish, you will be prompted on how to insert the file you're importing. Change the import location to `Replace data at selected cell` and import the data.
![Step 5b](/instruction_images/step5b.png) 

The data should now have been imported correctly. You can put the columns you moved in step 3 back where they used to be if you want to.
